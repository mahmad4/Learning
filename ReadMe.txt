The skeleton of the code was provided by Professor Ferguson.
Most of the code is well commented and documented

Decision tree and linear classifier are in separate folders

To run decision tree:
(After going to location of the src)
a. For WillWait problem follow the following commmands:
	javac WillWaitProblem.java
	java WillWaitProblem WillWait-data.txt
b. For house vote problem follow the following commmands:
	javac house_votes.java
	java house_votes house-votes-84.data.mod.txt

To run Linear Classifier:
(After going to location of the src)	
a. For PerceptonClassifier:
	javac PerceptronClassifierTest.java
	java PerceptronClassifierTest (filename) (nsteps) (alpha)
b. For LogisticalClassifies:
	javac LogisticClassifierTest.java
	java LogisticClassifierTest (filename) (nsteps) (alpha)
